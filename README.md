# vs-haxe
Basic solution I use to integrate haxe/hxcpp into my Visual Studio projects.

## Compile
Open the solution `haxeContainer.sln` make sure that the *haxe* projects is set as **startup project** and compile, you shoud see the output from Main class defined as
```Haxe
class Main {
    static public function main():Void {
        // Single line comment
        trace("Hello World");
    }
}
```



## Usage
Copy the file from the haxe output directory generated by hxcpp into the haxe folder `include` and `src`. Add missing files generated by hxcpp into the Visual Studio solution.

## To do
- Add Release configuration.
- Automatize the copy process.
